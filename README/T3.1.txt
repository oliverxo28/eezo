# EEZO — Proof of Task T3.1 Completion (Perf + Trust Hardening)

## ✅ Scope
Implements the four items from T3.1:
1) **Signature verification cache** (LRU) keyed by `(pk, msg_hash)`
2) **Rate limiting** (token bucket) on verifications
3) **Validator certificate** verification against **genesis trust root**, with validity windows & revocation check
4) **Mutual authentication** (client sends signed identity in `ClientHello`, server verifies)

## 🔐 Security & Performance Properties

- **LRU verify cache (4096 entries)**  
  - Key: `(PublicKeyBytes, Sha3-256(bound_message)) → bool`
  - Avoids repeated ML-DSA verify work under normal operation and during mild storms.

- **Token-bucket rate limiter**  
  - Defaults: capacity = 200 tokens; refill = 200/sec; cost = 1 per verify  
  - Behavior: under flood, verifications are throttled and fail closed.

- **Genesis-rooted validator certificates**
  - `ValidatorCertificate { validator_id, ml_dsa_pubkey, valid_from, valid_until, revoked, genesis_signature }`
  - Verification: detached signature by **genesis root**, time/height validity window, revocation flag.

- **Mutual auth (client → server)**
  - Client signs **client-id binding hash** over canonical `ClientHello` core with domain separation.
  - Server verifies before returning the session. (Optional in v1, enforced when present.)
