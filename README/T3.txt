# EEZO — Proof of Task T3 Completion (Hardened PQ Authentication)

## ✅ Scope
Adds a post-quantum authentication layer over the T2 secure transport with robust, audit-ready defenses.

## 🔐 Security Properties Implemented
- **Domain-separated transcript hash** (versioned, canonical, session-bound):
  - `EEZO-PQC-AUTH-V1` domain
  - Canonical `ClientHelloCore` + `ServerHelloCore` (auth fields excluded)
  - Bound to context: `salt_c || salt_s || session_id`
- **ML-DSA-44 signatures** (detached) with explicit context binding.
- **Race-free session exposure**: session is returned to caller **only after** signature verify.
- **Replay resistance** across sessions: transcript hash changes with context, so signatures don’t transfer.
- **DoS groundwork**: LRU cache scaffold included for verification path (to be wired in T3.1).
